✍️ Sample Write-Up (You Can Edit and Use This):
Write-Up for Wireframe Assignment
I have created wireframe sketches for both mobile and desktop views of my website. The site is a personal portfolio that includes a landing page, an "About Me" section, a gallery, and a contact form.

The mobile view is a simplified vertical layout with a hamburger menu and single-column sections for readability.

The desktop view uses a horizontal navigation bar, a three-column layout for the gallery, and visible social media icons.

The landing page sketch shows a hero image with a welcome message and a call-to-action button.

All sketches focus on structure and content placement without using color or styling.

Would you like me to generate sample wireframe sketches for you in image format that you can include in your assignment?

Instructions

This assignment requires that you create an image in which you show (and describe) the sketches you have created for you site. You will pay special attention to demonstrate that you have at least two unique views - one of which should be a mobile view.

Upload an image that shows the design sketches you have created for your site.

Each site should have at least two views (mobile and larger screen).

If you plan on having a landing page (a unique page that has a different layout than the others), make sure to include a sketch of that as well.

Remember, good wireframes should not utilize color, font etc. but it is okay to include content.

Please include a brief write-up.
